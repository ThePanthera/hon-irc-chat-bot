hon-irc-chat-bot
================

Brain/core communicates between 2 realtime bots, a IRC bot, and a honchat bot, both of them send data and recieve data
from brain to, brain loads module, upon request, meaning.

if someone in channel, with admin priveleges on both bots first runs a check if the game would be already started.

if not, prompts brain to load the certain module/plugin, upon loading, it selects randomly a question from a file
(scanner function would be useful in this case)
sets both bots to filter chat, with a certain keyword, blabla
